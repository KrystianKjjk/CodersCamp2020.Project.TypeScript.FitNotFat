## Used technologies

The goal of the project was to make use of Typescript to build a functional application. We used such Typescript elements as:

- basic types
- custom types
- merged types
- classes / interfaces
- access modifiers
- generic types

The project was developed using a Test Driven Development approach - tests for the newly developed components were written first and after that the component was created to meet the requirements.
